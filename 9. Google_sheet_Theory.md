# GOOGLE SHEET THEORY
# Section One: Spreadsheet Basics, Variables, and Shortcuts

#### Spreadsheet Basics
Spreadsheets are digital documents organized in rows and columns, allowing users to store, manipulate, and analyze data. In Google Sheets, you can create a new spreadsheet by navigating to Google Drive and selecting "Google Sheets" from the New menu. Once created, you can enter data into cells, perform calculations, and visualize data using charts and graphs.

**Example:**
```markdown
To create a simple spreadsheet:
1. Open Google Drive.
2. Click on "New" and select "Google Sheets."
3. Enter data into cells by clicking on them and typing.
4. Use basic formatting options to customize the appearance.
```

#### Variables
In spreadsheet terminology, variables refer to named cells or ranges that hold specific values. These values can be numbers, text, dates, or formulas. By assigning names to cells or ranges, you can easily reference them in formulas and functions throughout your spreadsheet.

**Example:**
```markdown
To define variables in Google Sheets:
1. Select a cell and enter a value (e.g., 10) into it.
2. Click on "Insert" in the menu bar and select "Named ranges."
3. Enter a name for the range (e.g., var1) and click "Done."
4. Now, you can use the name (var1) in formulas instead of cell references.
```

#### Shortcuts
Keyboard shortcuts are key combinations that allow users to perform tasks quickly without using the mouse. Learning and using keyboard shortcuts can significantly improve efficiency and productivity when working with spreadsheets.

**Example:**
```markdown
Common keyboard shortcuts in Google Sheets:
- Copy: Ctrl+C
- Paste: Ctrl+V
- Undo: Ctrl+Z
- Redo: Ctrl+Y
- Find: Ctrl+F
- Bold: Ctrl+B
- Italic: Ctrl+I
- Insert row: Ctrl+Shift++ (plus sign)
- Delete row: Ctrl+- (minus sign)
```

# Section Two: Introduction to Your First Functions

#### Basic Functions
Functions in spreadsheets are predefined formulas that perform specific calculations or tasks. Google Sheets provides a wide range of functions for various purposes, such as arithmetic, statistical analysis, and data manipulation.

**Example:**
```markdown
Using basic functions in Google Sheets:
- SUM: =SUM(A1:A10) calculates the sum of values in cells A1 to A10.
- AVERAGE: =AVERAGE(B1:B5) calculates the average of values in cells B1 to B5.
```

#### Application
Functions can be applied to different data ranges and scenarios to perform calculations and analysis efficiently. Understanding how to use functions effectively is essential for manipulating data and deriving meaningful insights from it.

**Example:**
```markdown
Applying functions to analyze data:
- Calculate total sales for each month using the SUM function.
- Determine the average score of students in a class using the AVERAGE function.
```

# Section Three: Introduction to Conditional Functions

#### IF Statements
The IF function in spreadsheets allows you to perform conditional logic based on specified criteria. It evaluates a condition and returns one value if the condition is true and another value if the condition is false.

**Example:**
```markdown
Using the IF function in Google Sheets:
=IF(A1 > 50, "Pass", "Fail") evaluates whether the value in cell A1 is greater than 50 and returns "Pass" if true, otherwise "Fail".
```

#### Logical Functions
Logical functions such as AND, OR, and NOT allow you to perform more complex conditional operations by combining multiple conditions.

**Example:**
```markdown
Using logical functions in Google Sheets:
- AND: =IF(AND(A1 > 50, B1 > 60), "Qualified", "Not qualified") checks if both conditions are true.
- OR: =IF(OR(A1 = "Male", A1 = "Female"), "Valid", "Invalid") checks if either condition is true.
```

# Section Four: Sorting, Filtering & Pivot Tables Crash Course

## Overview
In this section, you will master essential techniques for organizing and analyzing data efficiently in Google Sheets. We will cover sorting, filtering, and creating pivot tables to gain insights from your data.

## Sorting Data
Sorting allows you to arrange data in ascending or descending order based on specific criteria. This is useful for organizing data alphabetically, numerically, or chronologically.

### Example:
Suppose you have a dataset of student grades with columns for student names and their corresponding scores. To sort this data alphabetically by student names:
1. Select the entire range of data.
2. Click on the "Data" menu.
3. Choose "Sort range."
4. Select the column containing student names and choose "A-Z" or "Z-A" for ascending or descending order, respectively.

## Filtering Data
Filtering enables you to display only the rows of data that meet certain criteria. This helps in focusing on specific subsets of data and extracting relevant information.

### Example:
Using the same student grades dataset, you can apply a filter to display only the students who scored above a certain grade:
1. Select the entire range of data.
2. Click on the "Data" menu.
3. Choose "Create a filter."
4. Click on the filter icon in the column header of the scores column.
5. Set the filter criteria to show scores greater than a specified value.

## Pivot Tables
Pivot tables are powerful tools for summarizing and analyzing large datasets. They allow you to create interactive tables that can be customized to show different perspectives of your data.

### Example:
Continuing with the student grades dataset, you can create a pivot table to summarize the average score by class section:
1. Select the entire range of data.
2. Click on the "Data" menu.
3. Choose "Pivot table."
4. Drag the "Class Section" field to the rows area and the "Score" field to the values area.
5. The pivot table will automatically calculate the average score for each class section.

# Section Five: Lookups

## Overview
In this section, you will discover the power of lookup functions in Google Sheets. We will focus on VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, and other lookup functions to retrieve data from different sources and perform data analysis.

## VLOOKUP Function
VLOOKUP searches for a value in the first column of a range and returns a value in the same row from a specified column. This function is commonly used for vertical lookup operations.

### Example:
Suppose you have a product list with product names in column A and prices in column B. You can use VLOOKUP to retrieve the price of a specific product based on its name:
```
=VLOOKUP("Product A", A1:B10, 2, FALSE)
```

## HLOOKUP Function
HLOOKUP performs a horizontal lookup by searching for a value in the first row of a range and returning a value in the same column from a specified row.

### Example:
Using the same product list, if product names are listed in the first row and prices are listed in the second row, you can use HLOOKUP to retrieve the price of a product by specifying its name:
```
=HLOOKUP("Product A", A1:B2, 2, FALSE)
```

# Section Six: GOOGLE Functions

## Overview
This section explores advanced functions and features available in Google Sheets. You will learn how to leverage unique Google functions to enhance your spreadsheet capabilities and streamline your workflow.

## GOOGLEFINANCE Function
GOOGLEFINANCE retrieves current or historical financial information from Google Finance. It can be used to fetch stock prices, currency exchange rates, and other financial data.

### Example:
You can use GOOGLEFINANCE to fetch the current stock price of a company by specifying its ticker symbol:
```
=GOOGLEFINANCE("GOOG", "price")
```

## GOOGLETRANSLATE Function
GOOGLETRANSLATE translates text from one language to another. It automatically detects the input language and translates it into the desired output language.

### Example:
You can use GOOGLETRANSLATE to translate phrases or sentences from English to French, Spanish, or any other supported language:
```
=GOOGLETRANSLATE("Hello", "en", "fr")
```

# Section Seven: Import Range Data create an Excel format

## Overview
In this final section, you will learn how to import and manipulate data from various sources into your Google Sheets. You will also understand how to format data effectively for Excel compatibility.

## Importing Data
You can import data into Google Sheets from various sources such as CSV files, Excel files, and external databases. This allows you to bring external data into your spreadsheet for analysis and manipulation.

### Example:
You can import a CSV file containing sales data into Google Sheets by following these steps:
1. Click on the "File" menu.
2. Choose "Import."
3. Select "Upload" and choose the CSV file from your computer.
4. Click "Open" to upload the file.

## Formatting for Excel Compatibility
When importing data into Google Sheets that will eventually be exported to Excel, it's essential to format the data correctly to ensure compatibility. This includes formatting dates, numbers, and text according to Excel's standards.

### Example:
You can format date columns in Google Sheets to use the MM/DD/YYYY format, which is commonly used in Excel:
1. Select the date column.
2. Click on the "Format" menu.
3. Choose "Number" > "More formats" > "More date and time formats."
4. Select "MM/DD/YYYY" from the list of date formats.
