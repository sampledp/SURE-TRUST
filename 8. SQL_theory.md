# SQL Essential

## Basic Syntax

Learn the fundamental syntax of SQL queries, including how to select, filter, and order data.

### Example:
```sql
-- Selecting all columns from a table
SELECT * FROM employees;

-- Selecting specific columns from a table
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name FROM employees;

-- Filtering data using WHERE clause
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = 101;

-- Ordering data using ORDER BY clause
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY last_name ASC;
```

## Data Definition Language (DDL)

Explore DDL statements for creating, modifying, and deleting database objects such as tables, indexes, and views.

### Example:
```sql
-- Creating a new table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    department_id INT
);

-- Modifying table structure
ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR(100);

-- Deleting a table
DROP TABLE employees;
```

## Data Manipulation Language (DML)

Discover DML statements for inserting, updating, and deleting data in database tables.

### Example:
```sql
-- Inserting data into a table
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, department_id) 
VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 101);

-- Updating existing records
UPDATE employees SET department_id = 102 WHERE employee_id = 1;

-- Deleting records from a table
DELETE FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 1;
```

## Data Query Language (DQL)

Master DQL statements for retrieving data from database tables based on specified criteria.

### Example:
```sql
-- Basic SELECT statement
SELECT * FROM employees;

-- Filtering data using WHERE clause
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = 101;

-- Ordering data using ORDER BY clause
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY last_name ASC;

-- Retrieving data with aggregate functions
SELECT AVG(salary) AS avg_salary FROM employees;
```

## Constraints

Understand how to enforce data integrity using constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints.

### Example:
```sql
-- Creating a table with primary key constraint
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    department_id INT
);

-- Adding foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE orders
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_customer_id FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id);

-- Adding unique constraint
ALTER TABLE employees
ADD CONSTRAINT uc_email UNIQUE (email);

-- Adding check constraint
ALTER TABLE employees
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_salary CHECK (salary > 0);
```

## Functions and Aggregates

Learn about SQL functions and aggregates for performing calculations and transformations on data.

### Example:
```sql
-- Using aggregate functions
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_employees FROM employees;

SELECT SUM(salary) AS total_salary FROM employees;

SELECT AVG(salary) AS avg_salary FROM employees;

SELECT MAX(salary) AS max_salary FROM employees;

SELECT MIN(salary) AS min_salary FROM employees;

-- Using scalar functions
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name FROM employees;

SELECT UPPER(first_name) AS upper_case_name FROM employees;
```

## Views

Explore how to create and manage views, which are virtual tables derived from the results of a SQL query.

### Example:
```sql
-- Creating a view
CREATE VIEW high_salary_employees AS
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;

-- Querying data from a view
SELECT * FROM high_salary_employees;
```

## Stored Procedures and Functions

Understand the concepts of stored procedures and functions for encapsulating and executing reusable SQL code.

### Example:
```sql
-- Creating a stored procedure
CREATE PROCEDURE get_employee(IN employee_id INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id = employee_id;
END;

-- Calling a stored procedure
CALL get_employee(1);
```

## Indexes and Performance Optimization

Learn how to create and use indexes to optimize query performance and improve database efficiency.

### Example:
```sql
-- Creating an index
CREATE INDEX idx_department_id ON employees (department_id);

-- Querying data using an index
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = 101;
```

## Transactions and Concurrency Control

Explore transaction management and concurrency control mechanisms to maintain data consistency and integrity in multi-user environments.

### Example:
```sql
-- Starting a transaction
START TRANSACTION;

-- SQL statements

-- Committing a transaction
COMMIT;

-- Rolling back a transaction
ROLLBACK;
```

## Security

Understand SQL security principles and mechanisms for controlling access to database objects and data.

### Example:
```sql
-- Granting privileges
GRANT SELECT ON employees TO user_name;

-- Revoking privileges
REVOKE SELECT ON employees FROM user_name;
```

## Advanced SQL Features

Discover advanced SQL features and techniques for handling complex queries, data manipulation, and performance optimization.

### Example:
```sql
-- Using common table expressions (CTE)
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = 101
)
SELECT * FROM cte;

-- Using window functions
SELECT employee_id, salary, 
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
FROM employees;
```
