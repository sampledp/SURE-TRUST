# QUESTIONS ABOUT GROCERY SALES DATASETS

## What is the overall sales amount in grocery sales?

### Theory:
         
This SQL query calculates the total sales amount by summing up the 'sales' column from the 'grocery_sales' table. The result is displayed under the alias 'total_sales_amount'.

### Query:
```sql
SELECT SUM(sales) AS total_sales_amount
FROM grocery_sales;
```

## Who are the top 5 customers based on their total purchasing amount?

### Theory:

This SQL query retrieves the total purchasing amount for each customer from the 'grocery_sales' table, grouping the results by customer name. It then orders the results in descending order based on the total purchasing amount and limits the output to the top 5 customers with the highest total purchasing amount.

### Query:
```sql
SELECT customer_name, SUM(sales) AS total_purchasing_amount
FROM grocery_sales
GROUP BY customer_name
ORDER BY total_purchasing_amount DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## Which category has the highest sales volume?

### Theory:

This SQL query calculates the total sales for each category from the 'grocery_sales' table, grouping the results by category. It then orders the results in descending order based on the total sales and limits the output to display only the category with the highest total sales.

### Query:
```sql
SELECT category, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM grocery_sales
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

## What is the average discount percentage applied to orders?

### Theory:

This SQL query computes the average discount applied across all transactions recorded in the 'grocery_sales' table, providing the result under the alias 'average_discount'.

### Query:
```sql
SELECT AVG(discount) AS average_discount
FROM grocery_sales;
```

## How many customers were ordering the Fresh vegetables?

### Theory:

This SQL query counts the number of unique customers who have ordered items categorized as 'Fresh Vegetables' from the 'grocery_sales' table, presenting the result under the alias 'num_customers_ordering_fresh_veg'.

### Query:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(customer_name) AS num_customers_ordering_fresh_veg
FROM grocery_sales
WHERE sub_category = 'Fresh Vegetables';
```

## What grocery item is ordered very rarely?

### Theory:

This SQL query retrieves the sub-category of items and counts the number of orders for each sub-category from the 'grocery_sales' table. It then groups the results by sub-category, orders them in ascending order based on the order count, and limits the output to display only the sub-category with the lowest number of orders.

### Query:
```sql
SELECT sub_category, COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM grocery_sales
GROUP BY sub_category
ORDER BY order_count ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

## What is the total number of grocery items in the ordering list?

### Theory:

This SQL query calculates the total number of distinct sub-categories of grocery items recorded in the 'grocery_sales' table, providing the result under the alias 'total_grocery_items'.

### Query:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sub_category) AS total_grocery_items
FROM grocery_sales;
```

## In overall sales, which category of grocery item has the least amount of profit?

### Theory:

This SQL query calculates the total profit for each category of grocery items from the 'grocery_sales' table. It then groups the results by category, orders them in ascending order based on the total profit, and limits the output to display only the category with the lowest total profit.

### Query:
```sql
SELECT category, SUM(profit) AS total_profit
FROM grocery_sales
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_profit ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

## On which date customers place more orders?

### Theory:

This SQL query retrieves the order date and counts the number of orders placed on each unique order date from the 'grocery_sales' table. It then groups the results by order date, orders them in descending order based on the number of orders, and limits the output to display only the order date with the highest number of orders.

### Query:
```sql
SELECT order_date, COUNT(*) AS num_count
FROM grocery_sales
GROUP BY order_date
ORDER BY num_count DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

## Which city of customers placed fewer grocery orders?

### Theory:

This SQL query selects the city and counts the number of orders made from each unique city in the 'grocery_sales' table. It then groups the results by city, orders them in ascending order based on the number of orders, and limits the output to display only the city with the lowest number of orders.

### Query:
```sql
SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS num_orders
FROM grocery_sales
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY num_orders ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

## What are the top 5 cities based on sales amount?

### Theory:

This SQL query retrieves the city and calculates the total sales amount for each city from the 'grocery_sales' table. It then groups the results by city, orders them in descending order based on the total sales amount, and limits the output to display the top 5 cities with the highest total sales amount.

### Query:
```sql
SELECT city, SUM(sales) AS total_sales_amount
FROM grocery_sales
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY total_sales_amount DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## Which single grocery item has sold with the maximum profit?

### Theory:

This SQL query retrieves the maximum profit recorded in the 'profit' column of the 'grocery_sales' table.

### Query:
```sql
SELECT MAX(profit) AS maximum_profit
FROM grocery_sales;
```

## How many customers get 0.30 to 0.35% of discount?

### Theory:

This SQL query calculates the count of unique customers who made purchases with a discount between 30% and 35% from the 'grocery_sales' table. It filters the data based on the discount range specified in the WHERE clause and provides the result under the alias 'count_customers'.

### Query:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(customer_name) AS count_customers
FROM grocery_sales
WHERE discount BETWEEN 0.30 AND 0.35;
```

## Which year has the highest grocery order?

### Theory:

This SQL query extracts the year from the 'order_date' column, counts the total number of orders made in each year, and then groups the results by the extracted year. The results are ordered by the count of orders in descending order, indicating the years with the highest number of orders first.

### Query:
```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS order_year, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM grocery_sales
GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date)
ORDER BY COUNT(order_date) DESC;
```
```
